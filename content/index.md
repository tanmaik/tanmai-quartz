Welcome!

I'm Tanmai. 

I am a computer science & math student at [The University of Virginia](https://virginia.edu), and I'm expecting to graduate by the spring of 2027. Before this, I attended [Pitt](https://pitt.edu) (which I transferred from after my first year) and the [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu).

Apart from school, I've been coding since I've been 5 years old and have completed many interesting software projects. I'm mainly interested in AI, startups, economics and politics. Since I'm a college student, I solve a lot of problems for myself using software.
